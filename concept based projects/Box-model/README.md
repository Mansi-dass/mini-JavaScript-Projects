This mini project illustrates the most basic and most important concept for css foundation i.e. Box-model.

### Box-Model
Its like a box which wraps every HTML element, and used for design and layout. It mainly consists of 4 parts:
- Content - Actual content (like text or image) present inside HTML element.
- Padding - Padding provides space (that is transparent) between the border and the content. 
- Border - Border creates an actual boundry, for padding and content and bind them inside.
- Margin - Margin provides space (that is transparent) just like padding but outside the border.
