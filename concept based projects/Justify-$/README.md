Experience it live here :- [justify-$](https://codepen.io/mansiiiii/full/gOdeZpE)

This mini project is an illustration of Justify-$ : ( Justify-content & Justify-items & Justify-self ) properties with which you can interact and understand its implementation better.

### Justify-$:
#### Justify-content:
The justify-content property in CSS, defines how browser distributes spaces around and between the contents/items along the main-axis of a flex container (that is set by flex-direction property: (row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse), and the inline axis of a grid container.

#### Justify-items:
The justify-items property in CSS, defines the default justify-self for all items of the box, giving them all a default way of justifying each box along the appropriate axis.
- This property is ignored when using flexbox.

#### justify-self:
The justify-self property in CSS, sets the way a box is justified inside its alignment container along the appropriate axis.
- This property is ignored when using flexbox.
